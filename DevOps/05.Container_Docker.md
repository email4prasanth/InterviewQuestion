1. what is docker?
    - Docker is open source containerization platform. It is used to manage the life cycle of containers, I used docker to build docker images, write docker files, run docker containers and push the docker files to container registry.  

2. How containers are differ from virtual machine.
    - Containers are very light weight virtual machine because it doesnot have complete Operating system but with necesary dependencies and libraries to run the application Ex: For java application we need javaruntime dependencies to run the app and libraries. where as in virtual machine contians Operating system with inbuilt packages. In Linux version like Ubuntu or Amazon Linux can be deployed by using ec2 instance which contains all system librares and kernel.

3. What is docker lifecycle?
    - In my case developer approcah us to containiers an application. we use to write dockerfile with set of instruction to run the application, once i feel the docker file is completed then using docker cli we run the commands to `docker build` convert docker file to docker image, using `docker run` we can crete docker container, we can push the image to external registry like dockerhub, ECR, ACR.

4. What are the different docker components?
    - **Docker client** contain build, run, pull, push.
    - **Docker host** contain docker daemon that execute the instruction
        - for build it will create the image.
        - for run it will start the container.
        - for pull and push it will connect to registry.

5. Explain about dockerfile
    - It is text file with set of instructions to buld the image 
    - Docker file contain componets like RUN, WORKDIR, LABEL, ARG, COPY, RUN, EXPOSE, ENV, CMD.
    - RUN command is used to buid the image, CMD is used to execute the commands while we run the image.
6. What is the difference between COPY and ADD.
    - COPY command is used to copy the files from host system, where ADD will download and copy the files form URL.
7. What is the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT.
    - CMD instruction can override arguments during the exection of run time, ENTRYPOINT cannot edit, overwrite at `docker run`.
8. What are networking types in docker and what is default
    - Default networking type is bridge
    - We can change the default type and configure to bridge, host, overlay
    - **Bridge** network creates docker0 which virtually connects the application and etho0 to communicate with the outside world
    - **Host** network doesnot have IP address, directly created by system the conatiner is attached direclty to DOCKER HOST with out docker0.
    - **Overlay** Network is tunnelling network that connects mulitple docker daemons and different docker swarm communicate eachother.
9. Can you explain how to isolate networking between the containers
    - If we run `docker network` command it will display available commands. We can find
    ```
    create
    connect
    disconnect
    inspect
    ls
    prune (complete remove unused networks)
    rm
    ```
    Using `docker network create --driver bridge demo-network` will create new bridge network and can connect `docker network connect demo-network containerid or name`.
10. What is multistage build in docker
    - Mulitstage docker build is allows you build docker containers in multiple stage allows you to copy artifacts from one stage to another. This can achieve light weight containers. In my case in Multi-tire application with front end, backend and directtransfer we require **JRE** file at the end. We install all the require dependencies at different stages which makes the image size is high during the build phase. At the end we need only JRE IN MULTI STAGE BUILD so copy the requried binaries and instll the JRE.
11. What is distro less images in Docker?
    - Distro less images are very small and light weight images that contains only applications and it runtime dependencies with minimal OS libraries. It does not contain packages, shell like in Linux distribution. If VM are exposed to vulnerabilites because of installed dependencies, packages. whereas Containers are light weight with minimal dependencies are expected to free from vulnarabilites and security threats. `docker pull scratch` image size is 1MB (doesnot have basic command like curl,apt..)compare to `docker pull ubuntu` which is 100MB.
12. Real time challenges with docker?
    - Docker is a single daemon process. It is a single point of failure, for any reason Docker Daemon goes down the application will also goes down. Tools like builda, podman will address the challenge. I am learning podman tool where it doesnot have daemon can run the commands like `podman build`.
    - Docker Deamon runs on root user which is a security threat, suppouse if it is compromised for security reasons it will effect the other applications or host on the host.
    - Resource Constraint - If we run too many containers on single host it will cause resource constraints, the application will slow down or crash.
13. What steps would you take to secure containers
    - VM have their own Networks and O, impact of one VM network on another is less if the configuration like VPC, SG, are proper, In case of containers if we dont consider the security well then all container (individuall, team) will compromise.
    - **Distroless image** with minimal dependencies runtime with minimal OS is free from vulnarabilites
    - **Proper Networking** If requrire create seperate drive(bridge) network to isolate containers.
    - **Utile like Sync** is used to scan container images.
