#### Kubernets
32. what is a pod
 - It is smallest unit in kubernets application that can deploy and managed the containers. It represents single instance of running processor of a cluster. Pod is a basic building block of kubernetes cluster. A single pod contains one or more number of containers. kuberenets can manage the lifecyle of pods and thier components.
 33. write a pod manifest
 `kubectl create deployment app1 --image sreeharshav/fastapi:v1 --replicas 6 --dry-run -o yml > deployment.yml` and `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml`.
 - `kubectl expose app1 --port -80 --type Nodeport --dryrun -o -yml > service.yml` and `kubectl apply -f service.yml`
 34. How do you create pods in the project.
 - Using command deploy the n node cluster, intally the cluster dont have pods `kubectl get pods` if you run `kubectl run testpod1 --image nginx:latest` we can see pods that deployed, this pods has unique network identity and communicate with another pod also.
 35. what is statefullset in kubernetes.
 - Each pod in kubernetes satefullset is assigned with stable network identity(hostname) based on `ordinal index` EX: stateful name `mysql` than hostname is `mysql0, mysql1`. 
 - It will follow order while deploying whenever a failure occurs and recreation takes place.
 - This will suppourt persistant volumes (PV) and Persistant volume claims(PVC) to provide stable and persistance storge.
