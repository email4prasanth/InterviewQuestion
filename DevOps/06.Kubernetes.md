#### Kubernets
1. what is difference between docker and Kubernetes.
    - Docker is a container platform which is very light in weight contains minimal libraries and dependency to run an application. It discuss about the container Life cycle management. Containers are efromal in nature, it is a single point of failure, If a container goes down, the end user application also goes down. Docker Swarm is requried to group the container.
    - Kubernetes is an orchestration platform tool with smallest unit pod that contains one or more containers. It offers Auto Healing, Auto Scalling. As containers are efformal in nature, k8s offers clustering can create pod and reduces the down time. It also suppourts Load Balancing, integration with custom resource definitions like ingress controller.
2. What are the main components of [k8s Architecture](https://www.simform.com/blog/kubernetes-architecture/).
    - Cluster is a combination of control node and worker node, components of these cluster(sever) works collectively to a reliable and adaptable environment for containers in pod.
    - Controll node consists of following components
        1. kube-api server - The api-server encrypts the communication between the components of cluster uses TLS to ensure saftey. Authorizaiton and Authentication, Data validation, Manging API request, coordination b/w control node and woker node. An API server works only with etcd, **API Server proxy** is a builtin bastion that user (outside of cluster) can communicate with Cluster IP.
        2. etcd - It is used to store the data in key-value format that include information like pods, states, namespaces. API server uses gRPC(developer allows to create high performance API for micro service arch) to access etcd to maintain secutiry. Statefull component in control plane, etcd is the database for k8s. All objects (deploy.yaml, pod.yml) stored in /registry directory key in key-value format. 
        3. Cloud Control Manager - It integrates the kubernetes cluster with cloud platform API.
        4. kube Scheduler - when deploying a pod kube scheduler identifies the best worker node based on the performance requirements like CPU, MEMORY, affinity. This is possible because the etcd store the vital information to run smoothly.
        5. kube-Control Mananger - This handles the different controller and keeps the cluster to stay in desired state by creating replicas to the cluster
            - Deployment controller - deploy of multiple replicas of an app running in container.
            - Replica controllers - specific number of pod replicas run always.
            - Statefullset controller - follow ordinal index with statename.
            - Daemonset controller - run one pod on everynode.
    - Worker node are the execution units of pod. Each node contain multiple pods, each pod contain one or more containers
        1. kubelet - it act as an agent that register worker node with API server. It creates, modifies, delete the container in the pod, it also do liveliness, readness, mount volume as per configuration, report node status to API server. Kubelet starts Scheduler, Controll manager, API server in static pods while bootstrap the control plane.
        2. kube-proxy - It contain service and endpont. Service exposes the pod to traffic, endpoint holds the pod IP address and ports. It create N/W rules to send traffic suppourt TCP, UDP butnot HTTP run daemonset.
        3. Container-runtime - It is responsible for pulling images, allocating and isolating containers and also manage life cyle. Container runtime interface (CRI) is resposible for kubernetes to intract with Container runtime. Kubernetes suppourt multiple runtime like CRI-O, Docker Enginee and containerd. Open Container Intiative (OCI) sets standards for container runtime.

32. what is a pod
 - It is smallest unit in kubernets application that can deploy and managed the containers. It represents single instance of running processor of a cluster. Pod is a basic building block of kubernetes cluster. A single pod contains one or more number of containers. kuberenets can manage the lifecyle of pods and thier components.
 33. write a pod manifest
 `kubectl create deployment app1 --image sreeharshav/fastapi:v1 --replicas 6 --dry-run -o yml > deployment.yml` and `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml`.
 - `kubectl expose app1 --port -80 --type Nodeport --dryrun -o -yml > service.yml` and `kubectl apply -f service.yml`
 34. How do you create pods in the project.
 - Using command deploy the n node cluster, intally the cluster dont have pods `kubectl get pods` if you run `kubectl run testpod1 --image nginx:latest` we can see pods that deployed, this pods has unique network identity and communicate with another pod also.
 35. what is statefullset in kubernetes.
 - Each pod in kubernetes satefullset is assigned with stable network identity(hostname) based on `ordinal index` EX: stateful name `mysql` than hostname is `mysql0, mysql1`. 
 - It will follow order while deploying whenever a failure occurs and recreation takes place.
 - This will suppourt persistant volumes (PV) and Persistant volume claims(PVC) to provide stable and persistance storge.
