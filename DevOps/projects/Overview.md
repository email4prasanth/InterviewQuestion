# DevOps Engineer | Digital Signage Application  
## AWS | CI/CD | Containerization  

- Designed AWS infrastructure (**ECS, ALB, ECR, RDS**) using **Serverless Framework** for containerized **Spring Boot** microservices.  
- Automated **CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions)** for frontend (**S3 + CloudFront**) and backend (**ECS deployments**).  
- Managed multi-environment setups:  
  - **EC2 for dev** (scripted deployments).  
  - **ECS for prod** (blue-green via ALB).  
- Implemented **SQS** for offline TV messaging and **WebSocket (Spring)** for real-time status tracking.  
- Enforced security via **IAM roles, VPC, and Security Groups** across services.  

## Why This Works for Your Resume  
âœ… **Focuses on DevOps Impact**: Highlights **IaC, CI/CD, and AWS** rather than app features.  
âœ… **Quantifiable Actions**: Uses verbs like **"deployed," "automated," "configured"** to show ownership.  
âœ… **Tool-Centric**: Prioritizes **ECS, Serverless, GitHub Actions** over programming languages.  
âœ… **ATS-Friendly**: Includes **"CI/CD," "ECS," "Serverless," "IAM"** for better keyword matching.  

### ðŸ’¡ Enhancements:  
- **Add Metrics**: _"Reduced deployment time by 30% using Serverless Framework."_  
- **Mention Collaboration**: _"Worked with devs to containerize Spring Boot services."_
