- CI/CD: Any one of: 
    Jenkins, 
    Bitbucket Pipelines, 
    GitLab CI, 
    AWS/Azure DevOps, 
    GitHub Actions, 
    ArgoCD
write a yaml code for getting code from all branches and based on changes write a ci/cd  select the deployment environment on runtime.
1. what are the different stages of pipelines.
2. How will you store the Artifacts in ECR, how will recognize it is a latest.
3. Write an Azuredevops pipeline using python where it has to select different environment like prod, uat, development and has to choose different aws subscriptions and create resource like vpc, instance and launch 

### Base Syntax
- ADO pipeline should contain **trigger, pool, stages**
```sh
trigger:
    branches:
        include: develop
pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
stages:
- stage:
  displayname:
  jobs:
  - job:
    steps:
    - task:
      inputs:
    - script:
      displayname:    
```
