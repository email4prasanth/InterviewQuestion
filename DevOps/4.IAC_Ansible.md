#### Ansible
27. ansible script
```
---
- name: Ansible Syntax for reference
  hosts: dev
  user: ansible
  become: yes
  connection: ssh
  tasks:
    - name: install git in remote repo
      apt: >
      name=git
      state=present
```
- What is become: yes
    - It will act as root user, here we are using user ansible which is non root user we need `sudo` to install the command to avoid this we use become: yes.

28. In your project where you use ansible can you expalin an senario.
 - Consider an Environmet DEV or UAT there are 100`s of servers are available if devleoper wants to clone the source code from the git, manually installing is not possible all the servers, we can configure the system by writing an ansible playbook, If i write and execute the playbook in my local system it will automatically installed in host machines (DEV) environment.
29. How can i copy the files from one server to another servers
    - write a playbook or inventories
    - In ansible configuration file we need to ucomment the inventory
    - In the server we need to add the user `ansible` and provide `password`
    - we need to generate a key from the master server using `ssh-keygen` and copy the key from master server to any other slave servers.
