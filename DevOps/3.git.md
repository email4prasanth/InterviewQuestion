- Flow
    - Working DIR -- Staging Area -- Local Repo -- Remote Repo
    - ![](https://github.com/email4prasanth/InterviewQuestion/blob/master/Images/GIT.png)
- Git- Distributed Version Control open source that can monitor, record the evolution of source code.
- Github - Platform for online hosting and coloborating on GIT repos.
- Git works by taking snapshots of project files and store everytime on commit.
- Local - With in the a member of a team/employee side.
- remote - Common repository that all team members exchange/perform opertions.


- **SETUP/Configure tooling**
    - `git config --global user.name "[name]"`
        - git config --global user.name "email4prasanth"
    - `git config --global email.name "[email]"`
        - git config --global user.email "email4prasanth@gmail.com"
    - `git config --golbal list`
- **Create repositories**
    - `git init` - turns existing directory into a git repository
    - `git clone [url]` - Download the existing repository available on github.
        - git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/pkg/controller/podautoscaler
        - It is recommned to clone by creating an empty folder.
- **BRANCH & MERG**
    - Any commit you make will be made on current branch
    - `git branch` - list of branches.
    - `git branch [branch-name]` - create new branch 
        - git branch prasanthmarri.
    - `git checkout [branch-name]`
        - git checkout yamunakutti.
    - `git merge [branch]` - merge specfied branch with current branch.
    - Example:
        git branch 
        git branch -b prasanthbranch (will create `iss53` branch and checkou to that branch.)
        git commit -a -m 'created new branch'
        git checkout master
        git merge prasanthbranch
- **INSPECT & COMPARE**
    - `git log` - show commit history for current active branch.
    - `git log branchB..bracnchA` - shows commit on branchA that are not in branchB.
    - `git diff branchB...branchA` - show difference on branchA that are not in branchB.
    - `git log --flow [file]` - shows version history for file and also rename history.
    - `git show [commit]` - shows metadata of the given commit.
- **TRACKING PATH CHANGES**
    - `git rm [file]`
    - `git mv  [existing-path] [new-path]` 
    - `git log --stat -M` - show all commit logs with indication of any path that moved.
- **Synchronize changes/Updates**
    - `git fetch` - Download files from remote repo to local repo
    - `git merge` - combines remote branch to local branch
    - `git pull` - fetch+merge, Download files from remote repot to working dir
    - `git push [alias] [branch]` - Upload files from local repo to remote repo
    - 
- **REWRITE HISTORY**
    - `git rebase [branch]` - apply any commits of current branch to ahead of specific one
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0chZFIZLR_0
    - `git reset --hard [commit]` - clear stagging area, rewrite from specific commit
- **TEMPORARY COMMITS**
    - `git stash` - save modified and stage
    - `git stash list`- list of staged files
    - `git stash pop` - write working from top of stack
    - `git stash drop` - discard the changes form top of stack

- What's the Difference Between Merge and Rebase?
    - merge will combine changes in two branches, rebase will apply commit ahead of specific one.
- What's the Difference Between Fetch and pull?
    - Fetch download from remote to local repo
    - Pull download from remote to working dir (pull = fetch+merge)
- How do you resolve merge conflicts, how can we aviod   
    - Editing the conflict code manually or using merge tools like KDiff3 that provides GUI
    - Entirely not avoidable but can minimize with proper communication and pull before pushing.
- How do you undo a commit that has already been pushed and made public?
    - using `git revert commit` generates a fresh commit that revers the eairler version, however `git reset` is not recommneded in pubic domain
10. how do you resolve merge conflicts
- Resolving merge conflicts is a critical skill for a DevOps engineer, ensuring smooth integration of code changes. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to resolving merge conflicts, along with best practices:

- Step-by-Step Approach to Resolving Merge Conflicts
    - Identify the Conflict: When attempting to merge branches (e.g., using git merge or git pull), Git will identify conflicts and notify you about the files that need resolution.
    - Review the Conflicted Files: Open each conflicted file to review the conflicting changes. Git marks conflicts within the file using markers:
    ```
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    Code from the current branch
    =======
    Code from the branch being merged
    >>>>>>> branch-to-merge
    ```
    - Analyze and Decide:  Analyze the differences between the conflicting changes. Decide how to merge the changes. This might involve keeping one version, combining both changes, or reworking the code to integrate both changes harmoniously.
    - Edit the Files:Manually edit the conflicted sections to resolve the conflict. Remove the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>) after resolving the conflicts.
    - Test the Changes: Ensure that the resolved code compiles and works as expected. Run automated tests to verify that the resolution did not introduce any issues.
    - Add and Commit the Resolved Changes: Once conflicts are resolved and tested, add the resolved files to the staging area `git add <conflicted-file`. Commit the resolved changes `git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in <conflicted-file>"`.
    - Complete the Merge: 
    ```
    git merge --continue
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```
11. Best Practices for Resolving Merge Conflicts
- Communicate with the Team:
    - Communicate with the team members involved to understand the context of their changes.
    - Collaboration can lead to better resolutions and prevent conflicts in the future.
- Frequent Merges and Rebases:
    - Regularly merge changes from the main branch into your feature branch to minimize the divergence and reduce the likelihood of conflicts.
    - Use rebase carefully to keep your branch up-to-date with the main branch without unnecessary merge commits.
