1. Github-Action is powerfull CI/CD tools which is dedicated to Github Repository.
2. Github-Actions doesnot require to install plugins, we need to create `.github/workflows` in the root repository.
3. There is no limitation to put number of `action.yaml` files, 
- one file (pipline) we can validate you may want to verify the user has given credentials, may want proper description like which issue it will solving. 
- In another file it may want to formating or linting issues.
