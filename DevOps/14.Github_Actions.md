1. Github-Action is powerfull CI/CD tools which is dedicated to Github Repository.
2. Github-Actions doesnot require to install plugins, we need to create `.github/workflows` in the root repository.
3. There is no limitation to put number of `action.yaml` files, 
- one file (pipline) we can validate you may want to verify the user has given credentials, may want proper description like which issue it will solving. 
- In another file it may want to formating or linting issues.
- CI is passing
- CD is passing.
- this is similar to argocd contain [.github/workflow](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/tree/master/.github/workflows)

#### why to choose self hosted runners over github hosted runners 
- [link](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners)
- Self-hosted runners offer more control of hardware, operating system, and software tools than GitHub-hosted runners provide. With self-hosted runners, you can create custom hardware configurations that meet your needs with processing power or memory to run larger jobs, install software available on your local network
1. For security reason 
2. If you are doing private project means code is not open
3. If github hosted runner doesnot match the resource requirment or dependencies.
