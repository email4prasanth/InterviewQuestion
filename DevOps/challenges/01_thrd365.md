# Project Migration and Rename from Platform 2.0 to Thinkrd365

## 1. Context and Challenge
The project was originally named **Platform 2.0**, with 3 environments (dev, preprod, prod) and 3 branches. During the project lifecycle, we faced two major challenges simultaneously:

- Expanding the testing environment (**QA**).  
- Fully renaming the project to **Thinkrd365** to align with the client’s commercial strategy.

Both tasks had **high operational risk** and required careful planning to **preserve commit history** and avoid **data loss**.

---

## 2. Technical Complexity
The complexity of the task included:
- The project is hosted in Azure cloud, and all the resources are hosted in a single directory using Azure intra ID (for the internal organization). The Azure cloud is maintained by the client side; they created a subscription and created a group and gave contributor, Key Vault Administrator, and User Access Administrator access. We used to raise Jira tickets to request service principals, create Azure AD B2C directories (dev, uat, prod), their DNS records, add users to Azure AD groups, and set up email accounts.  
- **Full rename of Azure resources** (VMs, Key Vaults, SQL servers, APIs, Static Web Apps, VNet, etc.), which carried high risk for **data loss and service disruption**.  
- **Migration while preserving Git commit history** across multiple branches:  
  - dev → development  
  - uat → QA  
- Integration with **Azure AD B2C directories** for new environments.  
- Managing **SSL certificates, DNS updates, and Key Vault reconfigurations** for each renamed resource.

---

## 3. Client and Team Requirements
- Followed the **client directive** to use a full rename despite higher operational risk.  
- Drawbacks:  
  - High risk of data loss and service disruption.  
  - Significant effort required for reconfiguration.  
- Addressed the **team leader requirement** to preserve commit history.  
- Ensured **minimal disruption** to other environments (preprod, prod).

---

## 4. Solution Approach
- **Created a migration plan** with 4 branches and 6 environments to align old and new resources.  

  1. develop branch with old environment (dev) and new environment (development)  
  2. uat branch with old environment (uat) and new environment (qa)  
  3. preprod branch with old environment preprod  
  4. main branch with old environment prod  

- **Stepwise migration**:  
  - dev → development  
  - uat → QA  
- **Terraform redeployment** to apply renaming without losing existing resources wherever possible.  
- **Coordinated with client** for Azure AD B2C, SSL, and DNS updates.  
- **Verified commit history** to maintain code traceability.

---

## 5. Outcome / Result
- Successfully migrated all environments with **full rename completed**.  
- **Preserved commit history** for dev and uat branches.  
- Met **both client and team leader requirements** with minimal disruption.  
- Demonstrated ability to **handle complex, multi-stakeholder DevOps projects**.

---

So now I know it is 4 branches and 4 environments with past commits of dev and uat environments.
