4. How do you collaborate with colleagues from different departments or backgrounds?
I usually start by understanding their goals and how our work can support them. When working with data scientists or developers, I focus on clear communication, breaking down complex technical issues and finding common ground to ensure seamless collaboration.

5. How do you handle change and uncertainty in the workplace?
I adapt by staying flexible and focusing on the core objective. In DevOps, changes are constant, whether in tools, processes, or requirements, and I respond by staying open-minded and updating my skills as needed.

6. Tell us about a time when you had to learn something new quickly. How did you manage it?
When I first started working on Kubernetes, I had limited knowledge. I quickly immersed myself in online courses, hands-on labs, and reached out to colleagues for guidance. This helped me gain confidence and start managing clusters in production within a few weeks.

7. Can you give an example of a time when you encountered a problem at work and how you solved it?
We once faced issues with inconsistent deployments due to manual interventions. I proposed and implemented a fully automated CI/CD pipeline, which reduced human error and sped up the release process, improving deployment accuracy.

8. What do you do when you don’t know how to solve a problem immediately?
I break the problem down into smaller parts, research possible solutions, and seek help from colleagues or online communities. If it’s an urgent issue, I prioritize finding a temporary fix while continuing to investigate a long-term solution.
