- What Is Cloud Computing
    - Cloud Computing is on-demand delivery of compute, storage, applications, databases and other IT resources through a cloud service platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- Six Advantages of Cloud Computing 
    - Go global in minutes
    - Increase speed and agility
    - Stop guessing capacity
    - Benfit of massive economies of scale
    - Minimzing capital expenses
    - Pay when you consume.
- What are the five characteristics of cloud computing (MRBRO)
    - Measured Service
    - Rapid Elasticity
    - Broad network access
    - Resource Pooling
    - On-demand self service
- Types of Cloud Computing 
- Cloud Computing Models 
    - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) 
        - Basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to Networking, computing, storage.
        - Exisiting IT departments are familar as IaaS provides highest level of flexibility and management control over IT resources.
    - Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
        - Infrastructure is readily available allows you to focus on develop, testing, deployment and management of your application.
    - Software as a Service (SaaS) 
        - Infrastructuer is readily availabe and service is maintaining by others.
        - End-user application you can focus on how to use the piece of software.

     - Public Cloud 
        - Cloud service provide over public internet available to **anyone** who wants to use.
        - Example: Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Azure Virtual Network (VNet), Google Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) 
     - Private cloud
        - Cloud service hosting within a private network infrastructure (on-premises or off-premises) used by **single organisation** and offer greater control, security and customizaton
        - Example: AWS Outposts, Azure Stack, Anthos.
     - Hybrid Cloud 
        - Combination of both public and private cloud models. It allows organizations to use a mix of on-premises, private cloud, and public cloud services, integrating them seamlessly to meet specific business needs. 
     - On-premises 
        - Cloud Created to our own business 
        - Computing resources that are deployed and managed within an organization's own data center or infrastructure.
     - Multi Cloud
        - Multiple cloud computing services from different cloud providers
        -  Offer redundancy, risk mitigation, and the ability to choose the best-of-breed services from different providers.
